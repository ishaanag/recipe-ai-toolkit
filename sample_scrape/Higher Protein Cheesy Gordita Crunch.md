## Ingredients
- [ ] 85/15 Ground beef, 227 g
- [ ] Chipotles in Adobo, a spoonful
- [ ] Tomato Paste, a spoonful
- [ ] Cumin, a sprinkle
- [ ] Salt, a sprinkle
- [ ] Ground coriander, a sprinkle
- [ ] MSG, a sprinkle
- [ ] Yogurt, 1 part
- [ ] Sour Cream, 1 part
- [ ] Ground coriander, a sprinkle

- [ ] MSG, a sprinkle
- [ ] Garlic Powder, a sprinkle
- [ ] Kashmiri Chili Powder, a sprinkle
- [ ] Lettuce, 30 g
- [ ] Cheese, 30 g
- [ ] Tomatoes, 15 g
- [ ] Hard taco shell, 2
- [ ] Keto flour tortillas, 2

## Instructions
1. Place a pan over high heat. 

Add the beef and smash it down into a thing later with your hands or a spatula. Season with the salt, msg, cumin, coriander, and chipotles in adobo. Let it sear until a nice browning forms on the bottom. 

Once it’s seared, smash up the beef into pieces. Add the tomato paste and mix it together.

2. Add all of the ranch components to a bowl. Mix together and adjust the seasonings to taste.

3. Gather all the remaining components. 

Lay the soft tortilla on the bottom of a pan. Add the cheese in an even layer and let it melt slightly. Cover the pan with a lid to steam the cheese.

4. Add the crunchy taco on top of the melty cheese tortilla. Fill the crunchy part with beef, a drizzle of spicy ranch, tomato, and lettuce. 

Close up the soft tortilla around the crunchy. Add it back to the pan and let it crisp up on each side before devouring. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.
