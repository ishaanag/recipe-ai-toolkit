## Ingredients
- [ ] 80/20 ground beef, 170 g
- [ ] American Cheese, 2 slices
- [ ] Brioche buns, 1
- [ ] Bacon, 1 slice
- [ ] Salt, a sprinkle

- [ ] Horseradish Condiment, 1 part

## Instructions
1. Place the bacon on a cold pan. Set the heat to low and let slowly cook until crisp on one side then flip and cook the other side. Set aside. Meanwhile prep the burger toppings.

2. Roughly form the ground beef into three 56 g balls of meat. Sprinkle the exterior with a generous pinch of salt. Roll them around so there is seasoning all along the outside.

3. Place the balls of meat on the hot griddle. Immediately smash until they are thin, a little smaller than 1/2". Let sear for about 30-60 seconds to let the crust to develop. 

Flip the spatula upside down, scrape the burgers from the pan and then flip over the burger. Repeat for the second and third patty. Immediately place a slice of American cheese on two of the patties, then assemble the meat tower. Turn off the heat.

4. Combine all the spicy mayo ingredients in a small container and mix well. 

Toast a bun and place sauce on the bottom, along with shredded lettuce, the crisp bacon, burger patties, pickled onion, and then more sauce on the top bun. Enjoy!
