## Instructions
1. Set a wok or deep vessel over medium-low heat and add enough oil to fry the chicken, about 2 inches deep. 

Meanwhile, flatten the chicken breast with a rolling pin, cast iron pan, or another blunt object. Optionally, cut the chicken into a square to fit the bread. Season both sides generously with salt. 

Combine all sauce ingredients in a small bowl and mix together. Set aside for serving.

2. Prepare the breading station with 3 plates or trays: one with flour and cornstarch, one with egg, and one with panko bread crumbs. 

Lightly coat both sides of the chicken in the flour, then move it to the egg, and finally, coat it with the bread crumbs. Press the bread crumbs into the chicken to ensure even coverage and sticking.

3. At the stove, use a thermometer to verify the oil is between 325-350°F/162-176°C. 

Slowly drop the chicken into the oil until it becomes golden brown. Fry the chicken for about 7 to 8 minutes, slightly agitating it throughout. 

When the internal temperature reaches 155°F/68°C, transfer the chicken to a paper towel on a wire rack, dab the excess oil, and then move it to the wire rack so it doesn't get soggy. 

While the chicken fries, prepare the sandwich toppings, wash the cutting board and breading plates, and wipe down your work surfaces. Always clean as you go.

4. Combine the mayo, lemon juice, garlic, MSG and salt in a bowl and mix it together. 

To assemble the sandwich, spread the mayo sauce on the bread, followed by the katsu-ish sauce and thinly sliced green cabbage. Top with the chicken and add more sauce over the top. Enjoy.
