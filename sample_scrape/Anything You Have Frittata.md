## Ingredients
- [ ] Cooking oil, as needed
- [ ] Aromatics,
- [ ] Raw vegetables,
- [ ] Meat,
- [ ] Eggs, 4-12
- [ ] Milk, 60-180 g
- [ ] Salt,
- [ ] Cheese,
- [ ] Herbs,
- [ ] Sour Cream,
- [ ] Hot Sauce,

## Instructions
1. Preheat the oven to 400° F/204°C.

Whisk together the eggs and milk (if using — it makes the frittata fluffier) with a generous pinch of salt.

Gather any meat, vegetables, or aromatic scraps you need to use up and chop them up.

2. Choose an appropriately sized oven-safe pan depending on how many eggs you have/want to use.

You want around equal parts egg mixture to sautéed vegetable and meat scraps. Use your spatial reasoning and pick a pan where the final mixture won’t go higher than 2/3 up the sides after covering the scraps (it’ll expand during cooking — don’t risk overflowing).

Guideline: for smaller frittatas (~ 4 eggs) use an 8” pan, for large frittatas (8-12 eggs) use a 12” pan.

In your selected pan, add a drizzle of oil and sauté the vegetables, aromatics, and meat (if included) over high heat until they are fully cooked and browned.

Next, pour in your egg mixture, and mix or shake the pan to distribute everything evenly.

At this point, you could always transfer the mixture to a larger pan (if needed), or alternatively, beat a few more eggs and add it to the pan if you need a fuller frittata.

3. Place the pan into the preheated oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes until the eggs are completely set. The frittata will typically puff up slightly around the edges.

Let it cool a bit, slice it, and garnish with your preferred toppings.
