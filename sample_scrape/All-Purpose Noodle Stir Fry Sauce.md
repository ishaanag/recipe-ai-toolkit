## Ingredients
- [ ] Soy Sauce, 2 parts
- [ ] Chinese Black Vinegar, 1 part
- [ ] Oyster Sauce, 1/2 part
- [ ] Garlic, 3 cloves
- [ ] Fresh ginger, 1 knob
- [ ] Sesame Oil, a spoonful
- [ ] Chinese red chili flakes, a sprinkle
- [ ] Cornstarch, 1 part
- [ ] Water, 2 parts

## Instructions
1. Combine all of the all-purpose sauce ingredients and mix together. 

This sauce makes a great stir-fry seasoning as is, but feel free to add aromatics or thicken the texture.

2. Add all of the additional sauce components: ginger, garlic, sesame oil, and red chili flake. 

Feel free to add whatever else you might like to your sauce now (siracha, scallions, etc.)

3. To thicken, add the noodle sauce to a pan over medium heat. Make a slurry of 1 part cornstarch and 2 parts water. Once the noodle sauce is simmering, drizzle in the slurry little by little until it thickens to your desired texture.

Thickening the sauce ahead of time is optional. You can always wait to add a starch slurry during the final stages of stir-frying with all the other ingredients.

4. Use with noodles, vegetables, and meats of all sorts.
