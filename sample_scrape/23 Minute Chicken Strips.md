## Instructions
1. Slice the chicken thighs into 1 to 1.5-inch strips. Place them in a bowl with the milk, salt, MSG, and lemon juice. Mix roughly to combine. The milk will help the flour dredge stick to the chicken. 

Meanwhile, set a wok or deep pot over medium heat and add enough oil to fry the chicken strips, probably about 2 inches.

2. While that's coming to temp, combine the flour, cornstarch, and pepper in a bowl. Take the milk chicken and pour a little bit into the dredge and mix it in. This will create nice clumps that get fried and crisp. 

Move the chicken strips to the flour mixture and coat them until completely covered. Press the flour into the chicken so the layer really sticks.

3. At the stove, use a thermometer to verify the oil temperature is between 350-375°F/176-190°C. 

Slowly drop the chicken thigh pieces into the oil until they become golden brown. In total, fry the chicken for about 6 to 8 minutes, agitating and flipping a couple of times. I like to pull my chicken at 155°F/68°C. 

Move the strips to a paper towel on a wire rack, dab the excess oil, and then place them on the wire rack so they don't get soggy. 

While the frying magic happens, you can wash your milk bowl, clean up the excess dredge, and wipe down your work surfaces. Always clean as you go.

4. For the first lemon pepper sauce, add butter to a medium-heat pan and melt until bubbly and the water starts to evaporate. Turn the heat to low and add lemon zest, lemon juice, garlic powder, and a lot of black pepper. Mix to combine, then transfer to a container and shake to emulsify. 

For the second sauce, mix lemon zest, garlic powder, and black pepper with buffalo sauce in a bowl.

5. Add the fried strips to a bowl and toss with the lemon pepper seasoning of your choice. Serve with a sauce and enjoy.
