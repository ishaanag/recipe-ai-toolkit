## Instructions
1. Set a cast-iron pan over medium to preheat. 

Meanwhile, mix the mayo and spices into a bowl. Add the chicken and slather the marinade on the exterior, making sure the thighs are well coated. 

Add the chicken to the pan and sear on each side until well browned. Cook the thighs until their internal temp is at least 176°F/80°C. Remove from the pan, slice into thin strips, and set aside.

2. Drizzle oil into a pan over medium-low heat. 

Add diced jalapeño and cumin seeds and bloom until just fragrant, about 1 minute. 

Add the drained pintos beans and sauté for 4-5 minutes or until heated through. Turn off the heat and set aside.

3. Use a large pan to warm the tortillas until pliable. This will ensure they don’t break during rolling. Meanwhile, gather or prep any remaining toppings.

4. To assemble a burrito, take a warm tortillas and spread a thin layer of sour cream on the bottom which will act as a glue and moisture barrier for the toppings. Then make sure to position the remaining toppings in a line on the upper third of the burrito. 

First, hit it with a layer of the seasoned beans followed by some hot sauce. Next a generous helping of the chicken then a sprinkle of queso fresco, the diced tomatoes minced cilantro, some shredded lettuce, and the pickled onions.

Repeat with remaining burritos. You should have enough chicken and beans to make 3-4 burritos total.
