## Instructions
1. Add the chicken thighs to a bowl along with a heaping spoonful of mayo. Add a generous sprinkle of each of the spices you are going to be using. 

Alternatively, make a spice mix by first combining any spices you’re looking to finish off in a bowl. Then add a few spoonfuls to the chicken and reserve the rest.

Massage the chicken until the mayo & spice marinade evenly coats each piece.

2. To pan or griddle set on high heat, press the chicken thighs flat onto the hot cooking surface. 

Allow the chicken to sear on one side until browning develops. 

Meanwhile, pop a serving of frozen fries into the air fryer according to package directions, or into a preheated 450°F/230°C oven to roast until warmed through and crispy. 

Use a small handful of fries per pita wrap, but the amount is up to you.

3. When the chicken pieces have developed color and light charring, flip them and continue searing on their second side. 

Meanwhile, prep the vegetables & combine them in a bowl. Toss with a sprinkle of the sumac, za’atar, and salt, along with a drizzle of olive oil and lemon juice. 

Taste and adjust with more seasonings, salt, lemon, or oil. Set aside.

4. Mix the mayo, yogurt, lemon juice, za’atar, & black pepper until combined. Taste and adjust as needed, optionally thinning the texture with extra lemon juice or water. 

When the chicken thighs are nicely charred on each side and have reached an internal temp of 180°F/83°C, remove them from the heat.

5. Warm the pitas in the microwave to soften (check every 15 seconds). Slice the chicken into thin strips. 

To assemble a wrap, spread a spoonful of muhammara as a base. Layer on a handful of fries, sliced chicken, salad, and then top with a drizzle of white sauce. 

Optionally wrap in foil to help contain the sandwich. Repeat with remaining servings.
