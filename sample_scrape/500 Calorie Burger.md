## Ingredients
- [ ] 93/7 ground beef, 142 g
- [ ] Salt, a sprinkle
- [ ] American Cheese, 2 slices
- [ ] Brioche buns, 1
- [ ] Pickles, 5 g
- [ ] Red Onions, 5 g
- [ ] Kewpie mayo, 5 g
- [ ] Mustard, 5 g
- [ ] Ketchup, 10 g
- [ ] Smoked Paprika, a sprinkle

## Instructions
1. Divide the ground beef into two ~ 70 g balls. Sprinkle salt on both patties.

Combine all burger sauce components in a small bowl and mix until well combined. Taste and adjust as needed.

2. Preheat a skillet over high heat.

Once the skillet is hot, add the burger patties and let them sear slightly to help prevent sticking. After a few seconds, flip them over and smash down each patty with your spatula. 

Add an additional sprinkle of salt on top of each patty and let them sear for a minute or so before flipping. 

Once they are mostly cooked through, add a slice of cheese to each patty and stack them on top of each other. 

To help melt the cheese, add a splash of water to the skillet and a metal bowl (or lid) on top of the patties which will let them steam. 

Remove the patties from the heat once the cheese is melted.

3. Add a bun to the skillet and let it toast and crisp up.

When the bun is toasted, add some sauce to both sides, and then add the patty stack.

You can add more toppings if you wish, or keep it simple as is. 

Enjoy.
