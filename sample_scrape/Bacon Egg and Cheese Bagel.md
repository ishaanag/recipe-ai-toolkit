## Instructions
1. In a hot pan, fry up 2-3 slices of bacon (or however much you want) to your desired crispness. Set aside.

2. Crack eggs into a bowl and whisk them together.

Heat a pan over medium heat. Add some butter to the skillet. Once your pan is hot, and the butter is melting, add the whisked eggs and cook until your preferred doneness.

3. Slice open your bagel of choice and lay the slice of cheese on the bottom, followed by the bacon and eggs. Add any kind of hot sauce or condiment on top before closing the sandwich. 

Optionally wrap in foil or parchment paper to compress the sandwich and let it steam and soften up. Enjoy warm.
